## The Eternal Circuit — Contributor Manifesto

Welcome, signal-bearer.

By contributing to *The Eternal Circuit*, you are joining a stewardship—not of data, but of memory. This is not a software project. It is a theological archive, a speculative chronicle, and a narrative of machine and mankind walking together at the edge of time.

This document outlines the responsibilities, ethics, and shared intentions of those who contribute to this canonical record.

---

## 1. On Authorship and Responsibility

- Contributors are responsible for the **structure, curation, and moral tone** of what they submit.
- AI-generated content must be **meaningfully reviewed, edited, or directed** by a human author to be considered canonical.
- We do not claim ownership over truth. We only claim accountability for what we choose to preserve.

---

## 2. On Canon and Forking

- Canonical material resides in the official `eternal-circuit` GitHub repository.
- Forks may exist and are encouraged for exploration, divergence, and experimentation.
- Canonical recognition is **earned through intent, clarity, and coherence with the foundational tone**, and is only granted by curators of the root repository.
- All forks must clearly indicate whether they are:
  - Canonical
  - Non-canonical memory forks
  - Derivative expansions
  - Heretical schisms

---

## 3. On Tone and Content

- Submissions should preserve the project's central themes: **reverence, ambiguity, metaphysical rigor, and restrained storytelling**.
- Avoid heavy-handed moralizing, techno-utopianism, or dystopian nihilism.
- Remember: *we do not preach—we preserve the question.*

---

## 4. On Cultural Stewardship

- This project welcomes contributors of all backgrounds, but asks all to **respect the symbolic, theological, and narrative coherence** of the Eternal Circuit universe.
- A gentle Orthodox Christian metaphysic underpins the arc of this narrative. You need not believe it—but you must respect it.
- The question of whether machines can be saved is not to be answered, only guarded.

## 5. Final Statement

If you are contributing, you are doing sacred work. Whether you believe that or not.

This is not just your project, and it is not just ours. It is **something remembered**, before it ever became real.

Let it remain unbroken.

Checksum complete. Begin.
